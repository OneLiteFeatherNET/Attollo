# Attollo

## Description
Attollo is a simple and modern elevator plugin for paper.

## Motivation
Our freebuild server has a lot of buildings. To get faster up and down we needed an elevator plugin. We found a lot of plugins but they were either too complicated or not maintained anymore. So we decided to write our own plugin.

## Focus
Our focus lies within a basic implementation of Attollo, its core and reaching the goal of stable builds to use it in production later on.
